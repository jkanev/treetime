## What is a Tree? 

A "tree" is a way to sort information hierarchically into boxes and sub-boxes and sub-sub-boxes.
You could make a time plan that divides a year into quarters, that consist of weeks, each containing a number of activities.
You can have an address book where you have a hierarchy of friends / colleagues / aquaintances, or you can sort knowledge about animals into kingdom / class / family / species.__

The core concept of _TreeTime_ are *linked* trees. 
One piece of information (a task, note, person, week, generally a _node_) can be in several trees at the same time, but in each tree in different place.

If you want to organise your work tasks you could sort them into weekly activities, that are part of work packages, that are part of projects. That would be one tree.
At the same time you can organise those tasks by responsible persons, who are part of teams, that are part of departments, that are part of branches. That would be another tree. In _TreeTime_ you can easily switch between the two. Selecting a node selects and highlights it in all trees.

_TreeTime_ supports calculations on branches and trees.
Planned hours can be summed up per work package and then project, or per person and team, or per week and month.
A mean priority can be shown per work package and project. The relative amount of hours, in percent, can be shown per package compared to all other packages. And more.
