Tree Fields
===========

General Syntax
--------------

Each tree field is a function with a list of input fields. These fields can be either tree fields or data fields. To avoid ambiguities it is good practice to name tree fields starting with a capital letter and data fields with a lower case letter. A tree field is always defined as part of a tree (see previous chapter). The definition states the name, the field type, and the input parameters::

        field "Name"
            field-type "type"
            own-fields [...]
            child-fields [...]
            sibling-fields [...]
            parent-fields [...]

The field is started by the line ``field "Name"`` where "Name" is the name of the field. This will appear as the column heading in the tree list.
After this, indented with four spaces, is the field type: ``field-type "type"``, where "type" is the type (see next for an overview).
After this, the lines ``own-fields [...]``, ``child-fields [...]``, ``sibling-fields [...]``, and ``parent-fields [...]`` each define a list of field names. These are the input parameters for the function. They are evaluated in the order they are mentioned. A real-world example::

        field "Progress"
            field-type "ratio-percent"
            own-fields ["Spent Hours", "Planned Hours"]
            child-fields []
            sibling-fields []
            parent-fields []
  
The tree field "Progress" is a ratio, defined as parameter1 / (parameter2 + parameter3 + ...). In the tree view it will be displayed as a percentage. It shows the ratio of the tree fields "Spent Hours" / "Planned Hours".

Hidden Fields
-------------

Sometimes calculations are more complex than mere ratios, products or sums. The result of any field can be the input of
any other field, provided there are no circular dependencies. If chained calculations are needed but intermediate
values not interesting, intermediate field can be made *hidden*.

        field "_sum(x)"
            field-type "ratio-percent"
            own-fields ["Spent Hours", "Planned Hours"]
            child-fields []
            sibling-fields []
            parent-fields []
            hidden

Using the keyword `hidden` after the other field definitions creates a "hidden" field. It can be used for calculations
in the tree, but will neither be visible in the GUI, nor in the export.


string
------

The simple display of the content of one or multiple data fields or tree fields.
Syntax::

        field "Name"
            field-type "string"
            own-fields ["field1"]
            child-fields []
            sibling-fields []
            parent-fields []

Result: The values or strings found in the fields *field1, field2, field3, ...*, put together, in the order they are mentioned.

url
---

Same as "string", but in an html export the field is formated as url link (clickable).

text
----

Same as "string", but the exported field has a larger width and can span several lines.

sum
---

The sum of all input fields.
Syntax::

        field "Name"
            field-type "sum"
            own-fields ["field1", "field2", ...]
            child-fields ["field3", ...]
            sibling-fields [...]
            parent-fields [...]

were "field1", "field2", "field3", ..., are the names of data or tree fields. Fields must be integer fields, the result for string fields is not defined.

Result: The value *field1 + field2 + field3 + ...*.

set
---

A list of unique occurrences of values of all input fields.
Syntax::

        field "Name"
            field-type "set"
            own-fields ["field1", "field2", ...]
            child-fields ["field3", ...]
            sibling-fields [...]
            parent-fields [...]

were "field1", "field2", "field3", ..., are the names of data or tree fields.

Result: A list like *value1, value2, value3, value4*, where each value is the value of at least on input field and each value is listed only once, sorted alphabetically.

sum-time
--------

Same as "sum", but will show the result as hour format, e.g. the value *1.5* will be displayed and exported as *1:30:00*.

difference
----------

Difference of numbers.
Syntax::

        field "Name"
            field-type "difference"
            own-fields ["field1", "field2", ...]
            child-fields ["field3", ...]
            sibling-fields [...]
            parent-fields [...]

were "field1", "field2", "field3", ..., are the names of data or tree fields.

Result: The value *field1 - (field2 + field3 + ...)*, in the order they are mentioned.

difference-time
---------------

Same as "difference", but will show the result as hour format, e.g. the value *1.5* will be displayed and exported as *1:30:00*.

mean
----

The statistical mean of all input fields.
Syntax::

        field "Name"
            field-type "mean"
            own-fields ["field1", "field2", ...]
            child-fields ["field3", ...]
            sibling-fields [...]
            parent-fields [...]

were "field1", "field2", "field3", ..., are the names of data or tree fields.

Result: The value *(field1 + field2 + field3 + ...) / N*, where *N* is the number of fields.

mean-percent
------------

Same as "mean", but will show the result as a percentage, e.g. the value *0.75* will show as *75 %*.

min
---

The minimum.
Syntax::

        field "Name"
            field-type "min"
            own-fields ["field1", "field2", ...]
            child-fields ["field3", ...]
            sibling-fields [...]
            parent-fields [...]

were "field1", "field2", "field3", ..., are the names of data or tree fields.

Result: The minimum value *min(field1, field2, field3, ...)*. This can only be for numbers. If you want to find the minimum of texts, use *min-string*.

max
---

The Maximum.
Same as *min*, but displays the maximum.

min-string
----------

The smallest of a list of strings.
Same as min, but can be used for text, e.g., names of branches collected by a *node-name* field (see below). Comparison is alphabetically, "aaaab" is smaller than "bc".

max-string
----------

The largest of a list of strings.
Same as *min-string*, but shows the maximum.

product
-----

The product of all input fields.
Syntax::

        field "Name"
            field-type "product"
            own-fields ["field1", "field2", ...]
            child-fields ["field3", ...]
            sibling-fields [...]
            parent-fields [...]

were "field1", "field2", "field3", ..., are the names of data or tree fields.

Result: The value *field1 * field2 * field3 * ...*, where *N* is the number of fields.

reciprocal
-----

The reciprocal of one input field value (or, if you enter several parameters, of the sum).
Syntax::

        field "Name"
            field-type "reciprocal"
            own-fields ["field1", "field2", ...]
            child-fields ["field3", ...]
            sibling-fields [...]
            parent-fields [...]

were "field1", "field2", "field3", ..., are the names of data or tree fields.

Result: The value *1.0 / (field1 + field2 + field3 + ...)*.

ratio
-----

The ratio between the first and the sum of all following input fields.
Syntax::

        field "Name"
            field-type "ratio"
            own-fields ["field1", "field2", ...]
            child-fields ["field3", ...]
            sibling-fields [...]
            parent-fields [...]

were "field1", "field2", "field3", ..., are the names of data or tree fields.

Result: The value *field1 / (field2 + field3 + ...)*.

ratio-percent
-------------

Same as "ratio", but displayed as percentage (e.g., 0.75 is displayed as 75 %).

node-name
---------

The name of the node's parent in another tree.
Syntax::

        field "Name"
            field-type "node-name"
            own-fields []
            child-fields []
            sibling-fields []
            parent-fields [N]

were *N* is an integer number.

Result: Displays the name of the node's parent in tree *N*. Trees are counted starting with 0.

Example: This field is called "Project" and is defined in a tree "Time", which is the first tree (i.e. Tree 0). There is another tree called "Projects", which is the third tree (i.e. Tree 2)::

    tree "Time"
        field "Project"
            field-type "node-name"
            own-fields []
            child-fields []
            sibling-fields []
            parent-fields [2]

    tree "Tasks"
        ...
        
    tree "Projects"
        ...

This would create the column "Project" in the tree view of the "Time" tree. The line ``parent-fields[2]`` means each entry shows the respective node's parent in the "Project" tree (e.g. "TreeTime").
 
node-path
---------

Same as "node-name", but instead of the paren't name, the entire path is shown, using "\|" as delimiter (e.g. "Coding \| Open Source \| TreeTime").
