History and Road Map
====================

Past
----

2015
^^^^

* November: First implementation, simple data types, simple GUI

2016
^^^^

* February: Implemented selection (the same item gets selected in all trees, changing a tab shows the same item)
* March: Implemented remaining local functionality (Copy Branch as Sibling, Copy Children to Siblings, Remove from this Tree, Delete Item)
* August: Created installable python package

2017
^^^^

* May: Implemented new field type *text*
* June: Create deployable packages for Linux and Windows
* June: Made **pre-release v0.0** available
* October: Implemented new field type *node-path*, re-wrote the way nodes move to new parents
* November: Uploaded package to pypi.python.org, *TreeTime* can now be installed using pip

2018
^^^^

* October: Re-implemented the parent selection mechanism. The old cascaded menus have been replaced with single drop down lists.

Present
-------

* Bugfixing
* Extend documentation on readthedocs.io
* Add more fields
* Add more examples and more template data files
* Structure editing/viewing in extra tab (editing the structure, number and definitions and trees and tree fields and data fields)

Future
------

Near Future
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Implement search function

Mid Future
^^^^^^^^^^

* Implement global functions (Linearise Tree, Level-Swap, Merge identical Siblings, Merge Identical Parents/Children, Remove all Orphans, Insert all Orphans as Children)

Far Future
^^^^^^^^^^

* Implement safe usage by multiple simultaneous users
* Implement a database backend instead of text file storage
* A whole lot of other fancy things that will probably never get done
